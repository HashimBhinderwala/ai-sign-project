# AI-Based Sign Language Translator

An AI-powered application that translates sign language gestures into human-readable text (and optionally speech) in real time using computer vision and deep learning.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the rest of the world by using machine learning models to recognize sign language gestures captured via a camera.

---

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection
- Webcam-based video input
- Deep learning model for sign recognition (e.g., CNN, MediaPipe, or a custom model)
- Text output for recognized signs
- Optional text-to-speech for translated output
- Web or desktop interface (optional)

---

## Tech Stack

- Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
- Flask or Streamlit (for web interface)
- gTTS or pyttsx3 (for speech synthesis)
